To improve the scripts for validating PCI-DSS compliance, it’s important to focus on accuracy, efficiency, and automation. Here’s feedback on the provided scripts and a Python version with improvements to address the feedback.
Feedback on Provided Scripts

1. Encryption Verification:

    Accuracy: Ensure that the scripts correctly identify the encryption protocols in use. The nmap and lsblk commands are useful but could be enhanced for more detailed checks.
    Efficiency: Automate protocol version checks to avoid manual interpretation.

2. Access Controls:

    Accuracy: Verify that access controls are indeed correct and do not overlook hidden permissions or misconfigurations.
    Efficiency: Implement automated checks for MFA and user access controls that integrate well with system APIs or configuration files.

3. Network Security:

    Accuracy: Ensure that the firewall and network segmentation checks are comprehensive and reflect current configurations.
    Efficiency: Automate firewall and segmentation checks to regularly audit configurations and detect deviations.

4. Automated Vulnerability Scanning:

    Accuracy: Ensure vulnerability scans are up-to-date with the latest vulnerability definitions.
    Efficiency: Automate the scheduling and reporting of scans to reduce manual intervention.

    Conclusion

These Python scripts offer improved accuracy and efficiency for PCI-DSS compliance validation. They automate tasks such as checking encryption protocols, verifying access controls, and performing network security assessments. By integrating these scripts into your workflow, you can enhance your compliance testing and ensure a thorough assessment of PCI-DSS requirements.

Ensure that you tailor the scripts to your specific environment and testing needs, and keep them updated with the latest security practices and standards.
