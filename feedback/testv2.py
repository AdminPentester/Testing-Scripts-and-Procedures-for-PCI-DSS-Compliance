Enhanced Script Example:

python

import ssl
import socket
import subprocess

def check_tls_version(ip):
    context = ssl.create_default_context()
    with socket.create_connection((ip, 443)) as sock:
        with context.wrap_socket(sock, server_hostname=ip) as ssock:
            tls_version = ssock.version()
            if tls_version in ['TLSv1.2', 'TLSv1.3']:
                return f"Supported TLS version: {tls_version}"
            else:
                return "Outdated TLS version detected."

def check_encryption_on_storage():
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(
            ["lsblk", "-o", "NAME,TYPE,FSTYPE,MOUNTPOINT,UUID"],
            capture_output=True, text=True, check=True
        )
        output = result.stdout
        if "crypto" in output:
            return "Encryption detected on storage."
        else:
            return "No encryption detected on storage."
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        return f"Error checking encryption on storage: {e}"

# Example usage
ip_address = '192.168.1.1'
print(check_tls_version(ip_address))
print(check_encryption_on_storage())

2. Access Controls

Feedback:

    Accuracy: The scripts for checking MFA and user access controls are useful but could be improved by validating configuration files more comprehensively.
    Efficiency: Automate user and group listing with more detailed checks for hidden permissions or misconfigurations.

Recommendations:

    MFA Check: Instead of using grep, use configuration management tools or APIs to verify MFA settings more comprehensively.
    User and Group Management: Integrate with system management APIs or tools that can provide a more complete picture of user permissions and roles.

Enhanced Script Example:

python

import subprocess

def check_mfa_installed():
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(
            ["pam-auth-update", "--status"],
            capture_output=True, text=True
        )
        if 'google-authenticator' in result.stdout:
            return "MFA is configured."
        else:
            return "MFA is not configured."
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        return f"Error checking MFA configuration: {e}"

def list_users_and_groups():
    try:
        users = subprocess.run(["getent", "passwd"], capture_output=True, text=True)
        groups = subprocess.run(["getent", "group"], capture_output=True, text=True)
        return f"Users:\n{users.stdout}\nGroups:\n{groups.stdout}"
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        return f"Error listing users and groups: {e}"

# Example usage
print(check_mfa_installed())
print(list_users_and_groups())

3. Network Security

Feedback:

    Accuracy: The scripts for firewall rules and network segmentation are solid but could benefit from more detailed analysis and integration with network monitoring tools.
    Efficiency: Automate the analysis of firewall rules and network segmentation with tools that provide real-time monitoring and alerts.

Recommendations:

    Firewall Rules: Integrate with tools like nmap or firewalld API to verify firewall rules more dynamically.
    Network Segmentation: Use network management tools or scripts to validate segmentation and routing configurations more effectively.

Enhanced Script Example:

python

import subprocess

def check_firewall_rules():
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(
            ["sudo", "firewall-cmd", "--list-all"],
            capture_output=True, text=True
        )
        return f"Firewall rules:\n{result.stdout}"
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        return f"Error checking firewall rules: {e}"

def check_network_segmentation():
    try:
        interfaces = subprocess.run(["ip", "link"], capture_output=True, text=True)
        routing = subprocess.run(["ip", "route"], capture_output=True, text=True)
        return f"Network interfaces:\n{interfaces.stdout}\nRouting table:\n{routing.stdout}"
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        return f"Error checking network segmentation: {e}"

# Example usage
print(check_firewall_rules())
print(check_network_segmentation())

4. Automated Vulnerability Scanning

Feedback:

    Accuracy: The vulnerability scanning scripts are effective but could be improved by integrating with advanced APIs and handling different scan scenarios.
    Efficiency: Automate the process to include scheduling, notifications, and detailed reporting to reduce manual intervention.

Recommendations:

    Vulnerability Scanning: Use APIs from tools like Nessus or OpenVAS to manage scans programmatically and handle results more efficiently.
    Scheduling and Reporting: Implement automated scheduling and reporting to streamline the vulnerability management process.

Enhanced Script Example:

python

import requests
import json

def run_vulnerability_scan(target_ip):
    try:
        # Example: Triggering a Nessus scan
        url = "https://nessus-server:8834/scans"
        headers = {
            "X-ApiKeys": "accessKey=your_access_key; secretKey=your_secret_key"
        }
        data = {
            "uuid": "scan_uuid",
            "settings": {
                "name": "Scan Name",
                "policy": "policy_id",
                "target": target_ip
            }
        }
        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data, verify=False)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return "Scan triggered successfully."
        else:
            return f"Error triggering scan: {response.text}"
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        return f"Request error: {e}"

# Example usage
print(run_vulnerability_scan("192.168.1.1"))

General Recommendations

    Security: Ensure that your scripts handle sensitive information securely and avoid hardcoding credentials in scripts.
    Testing: Regularly test and update your scripts to accommodate changes in compliance requirements and security standards.
    Documentation: Document your scripts and procedures clearly to ensure they can be understood and maintained by others.
