As a Senior DevSecOps, my feedback will focus on refining and optimizing the scripts and procedures you’ve outlined for PCI-DSS compliance validation. Here’s a detailed review and recommendations for each aspect:
1. Encryption Verification

Feedback:

    Accuracy: The provided Python scripts for TLS version checks and storage encryption are effective but could benefit from enhanced error handling and validation of encryption standards.
    Efficiency: The use of subprocesses is appropriate, but integrating libraries that provide direct access to encryption protocols and storage configurations could improve performance and accuracy.

Recommendations:

    TLS Version Checks: Consider using specialized libraries like pyopenssl for a more detailed analysis of TLS versions and cipher suites.
    Encryption on Storage: Enhance the storage encryption check by integrating with specific APIs or using dedicated tools that provide more granular details.
