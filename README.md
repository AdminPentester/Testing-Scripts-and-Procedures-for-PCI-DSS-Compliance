# Testing-Scripts-and-Procedures-for-PCI-DSS-Compliance
Objective: Verify that sensitive cardholder data is encrypted in transit and at rest as per PCI-DSS requirements.

Testing multiple Procedures:

    Verify Encryption Protocols:
        Script:

        bash

    # Check for TLS version on web servers
    nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 <target-ip>

    Procedure:
        Use tools like Nmap or OpenSSL to verify that only strong encryption protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2 or higher) are enabled.
        Check that outdated protocols like SSL 2.0/3.0 are disabled.

Check Encryption of Stored Data:

    Script:

    bash

        # Check for encrypted storage using filesystem commands
        lsblk -f | grep -i 'crypto'

        Procedure:
            Verify that data at rest is encrypted using strong encryption algorithms.
            Check the configuration of databases and storage systems to ensure encryption is enabled.

Automated Tools:

    Qualys SSL Labs: For scanning SSL/TLS configuration and ensuring compliance with secure protocols.
    Nessus: For identifying weak encryption settings and outdated protocols.

2. Access Controls

Objective: Ensure that access to cardholder data is restricted to authorized personnel and that robust access controls are implemented.

Testing Procedures:

    Verify User Access Controls:
        Script:

        bash

    # List users and their privileges on a Linux system
    sudo cat /etc/passwd
    sudo cat /etc/group

    Procedure:
        Review user roles and permissions to ensure only authorized personnel have access to cardholder data.
        Validate that user accounts are properly managed, including regular reviews and timely removal of inactive accounts.

Check Authentication Mechanisms:

    Script:

    bash

        # Check for multi-factor authentication (MFA) setup
        grep 'auth required pam_google_authenticator.so' /etc/pam.d/sshd

        Procedure:
            Verify the implementation of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing systems that store or process cardholder data.

Automated Tools:

    OpenVAS: For scanning and identifying misconfigured access controls.
    CyberArk: For managing and auditing privileged accounts and credentials.

3. Network Security

Objective: Ensure that network security controls are in place to protect cardholder data from unauthorized access and vulnerabilities.

Testing Procedures:

    Verify Firewall Rules:
        Script:

        bash

    # List firewall rules on a Linux system
    sudo iptables -L -v -n

    Procedure:
        Check firewall configurations to ensure that only necessary ports and protocols are open.
        Verify that firewall rules are aligned with PCI-DSS requirements for protecting cardholder data.

Check Network Segmentation:

    Script:

    bash

        # Display network interfaces and routing table
        ip a
        ip route

        Procedure:
            Verify that network segmentation is implemented to isolate cardholder data environments (CDE) from other parts of the network.
            Check routing and interface configurations to ensure proper segmentation.

Automated Tools:

    Nessus or Qualys: For vulnerability scanning and identifying insecure configurations.
    Snort or Suricata: For network intrusion detection and monitoring.

4. Automated Vulnerability Scanning

Objective: Regularly scan for vulnerabilities related to PCI-DSS requirements, including missing patches and insecure configurations.

Testing Procedures:

    Scheduled Scanning:
        Script:

        bash

        # Run a vulnerability scan with OpenVAS
        openvas-start
        omp -u admin -w admin -G -i <scan-id> -t <target-ip>

        Procedure:
            Schedule regular scans to identify missing patches and configuration issues.
            Review scan results and remediate identified vulnerabilities.

Automated Tools:

    Nessus: For detailed vulnerability scanning and reporting.
    OpenVAS: For open-source vulnerability assessment and management.

Implementation Steps

    Define Scope:
        Identify systems and applications that fall under PCI-DSS scope.
        Establish the boundaries for encryption, access controls, and network security testing.

    Create and Deploy Scripts:
        Develop scripts based on the procedures outlined above.
        Deploy scripts on relevant systems to automate compliance checks.

    Integrate Automated Tools:
        Set up and configure automated tools like Nessus, Qualys, and OpenVAS.
        Schedule regular scans and integrate findings into a compliance dashboard.

    Review and Report:
        Analyze the results from automated scans and manual procedures.
        Generate compliance reports highlighting findings, risks, and remediation steps.

    Continuous Improvement:
        Regularly update scripts and tools to align with evolving PCI-DSS requirements.
        Conduct periodic reviews and audits to ensure ongoing compliance.

By following these steps and utilizing the provided testing scripts, procedures, and automated tools, you can effectively validate PCI-DSS compliance and address security requirements related to encryption, access controls, and network security.
